# Quick Start

## First setup

Since `dynami` is Python based, `dynami` can be installed on any common operating system.

<Steps>

### Download installation script

The installation script will be available for download on GitHub and on our website. The script is available for every platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) and automatically installs all necessary packages - except for Windows, where Python has to be installed manually.

```shell copy
curl -sSL https://docs.bytesentinel.io/download/linux.sh | bash
```
