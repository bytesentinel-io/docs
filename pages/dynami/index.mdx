## Motivation of project

Not all DNS operators e.g. Hetzner support DynDNS. With `dynami` in a Docker container or on a small Linux server, this buggy feature can be added.

New providers can be requested via issue on GitHub. A temporary access for testing at the provider would be helpful. Otherwise, the integration cannot be tested.
