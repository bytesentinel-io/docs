## Motivation

Not all DNS operators e.g. Hetzner support DynDNS. With `dynami` in a Docker container or on a small Linux server, this buggy feature can be added.

## Requests

Please submit all requests via issue on GitHub. For discrete requests, please send email to <Link href="mailto:info@bytesentinel.io" className="">info@bytesentinel.io</Link>.

### Providers 

New providers can be requested via issue on GitHub. A temporary access for testing at the provider would be helpful. Otherwise, the integration cannot be tested.
